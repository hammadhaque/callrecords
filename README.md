Call Records: Reading in data into a dynamic array and calculating various things based off data such as call tax, total cost of call, along with adding call records into the dynamic array. All of this was done in C++ using OOP concepts.

Getting Started: you will need to have a C++ compiler such as Visual Studio 

Deployment: There are 3 files to be downloaded, the header(.h), the driver (.cpp), and the stub or class implementation file (.cpp). There is also a call records text file that will be used throughout the program. Make sure that all of these files are present in one folder. 

Built With: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

Versioning: we used MATLAB R2016a provided by Florida Atlantic University
